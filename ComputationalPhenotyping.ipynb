    "The classes have the following meaning: `Interphase` is normally related to the cell cycle and regroups all non-mitotic phases (G1, S, G2). Here however, we take `Interphase` as a shortcut for normal interphase, meaning that interphase nuclei are nuclei of normal, non-dividing cells. `Large` nuclei are ... large! `Elongated` nuclei are also non-dividing but have a an elongated shape, `Shape1` refers to two nuclei in close proximity (typically arising from cytokinesis defects), `Shape3` is an abnormal nuclear morphology usually resulting from segregation defects (i.e. the nuclei are not properly distributed to the daughter nuclei during division and / or the nuclear envelope does not form correctly). `Grape` is a variant of such a morphology, involving micronucleation. Then there come normal and abnormal mitotic phases: `Metaphase`, `Anaphase`, `MAP` (Metaphase Alignment Problems), `Prometaphase`, `ADCCM` (similar to `MAP`). Further morphological classes are: `Apoptosis` (cell death), `Hole`, `Folded` and `SmallIrregular`, all linked to problems in nuclear architecture.

In an unsupervised setting, we could certainly infer some of these groups from the data set without manual annotation. Others - as mentioned above - do not form individual clusters. In this case, it is essential to impose prior knowledge in form of manual annotations."

In general, the higher this number the better it is, but the resulting classifier will be slower also. Importantly, this parameter does not only affect training time, but also prediction time. For us however, this is not critical, and we set this parameter to 200. The second parameter is the `oob_score` which indicates whether to calculate the out-of-bag error. This is an error wich is only calculated on those samples that were left out for training the tree. Using the out-of-bag error allows us to avoid time-consuming cross-validation."
